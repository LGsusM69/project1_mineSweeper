# Minesweeper

### A classic minesweeper game.

The point of the game is to clear the whole field of any mines by uncovering all the cells not containing mines and marking the cells with mines.
The cells can be blank, they can have a number from 1 to 8, or they can have a mine.
For the cells with numbers, the number is defined by how many mined cells are adjacent to it.

This implementation of the game uses only HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.
